# Audio_Time_Signature_Calculator
The application will take audio (song) file as input and will return the time signature calculations of the song with JUCE framework and OOP in c++11.
Time signature is the skeleton of every song or beats.
Some of the popular time signature of the songs are: 4/4, 3/4, 7/8, 6/8, 5/4, and 10/8.
The application will determine such calculations of a song.
This project supports multiple platforms like Linux, Android, IOS, Windows, and others.
